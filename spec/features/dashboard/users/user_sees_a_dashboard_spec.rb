As a registered user,
When I visit "/",
I see a link for "Login",

When I click "Login",
I should be on the "/login" page,
I see a place to insert my credentials to login,
I fill in my desired credentials,
I submit my information,
My current page should be "/dashboard",
I see a message in the navbar that says "Logged in as SOME_USER",
I see my profile information,
I do not see a link for "Login",
I see a link for "Logout".
